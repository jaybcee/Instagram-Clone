# SOEN 341 project (Instagram)

## Description

This repo is for our SOEN 341 class, where the objective will be to create a web-app that mimicks *Instagram* and some of its core features. It will be held over 4 **sprints** and we will need to implement core functionalities such as posting pictures, following friends and commenting on posted pictures. We'll then be pitching and implementing additional features that are TBD. Our team will need to document everything on GitHub through the use of **commits**, **issues** and **milestones**.

## Methodology

`Issues` are to be open for **every** new feature, bug fix or release. They are to be assigned to a `milestone` (4 milestones will be made, one for every sprint). Commit messages are to be **meaningful** (they correctly describe the commit) and **include** "`fixes #xxx`" or "`closes #xxx`" to have them automatically close the related issue (`xxx` should be replacd with the correct issue number). For example, here's a *fake* commit message for issue #54: "*Fixed the bug showing users a weird grey bar, closes #54*". `Branches` are to be named as follows: `<sprint_number>/<type_of_commit>/<short_description>`. For example: `sprint1/feature/readme_update` or `sprint1/bug_fix/grey_bar`. Messages/meetings within the scope of this project should be sent/done over our Slack workspace, in respective channels, and then **documented** in our [wiki](https://github.com/Nicolas-MacBeth/SOEN341/wiki) page. Also, always assign yourself to your own PRs when they are created. Make sure
