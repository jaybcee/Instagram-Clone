# SOEN 341 project (Instagram)

## Description

This repo is for our SOEN 341 class, where we will be creating a web-app that mimicks *Instagram* and some of its core features. It will be held over 4 **sprints** and we will need to implement core functionalities such as posting pictures, following friends and commenting on pictures. We'll then be pitching and implementing additional features that are TBD. Our team will need to document everything on GitHub through the use of **commits**, **issues** and **milestones**.
