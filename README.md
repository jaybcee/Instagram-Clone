# SOEN341
SOEN 341 GitHub repository

## The project

This repo is for our SOEN 341 class, where we will be creating a web-app that mimicks Instagram and some of its core features. It will be held over 4 sprints and we will need to implement core functionalities such as posting pictures, following friends and commenting on pictures. We'll then be pitching and implementing addiotional features that are TBD. Our team will need to document everything on GitHub through the use of commits, issues and milestones.
